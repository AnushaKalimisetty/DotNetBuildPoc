In this activity, you will learn how to use Build Artifacts in GitHub Actions workflows. 
Artifacts are files or outputs generated during workflow runs that can be saved and 
downloaded later — useful for test reports, build files, or deployment packages. You’ll 
create a simple workflow that generates a text file as a build artifact, uploads it, and 
allows it to be downloaded from the GitHub Actions interface. This is especially helpful 
in CI/CD pipelines to pass data between jobs or keep logs for review.
